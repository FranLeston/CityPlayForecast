# CityPlayForecast
Predict the sales and number of employees needed for the next day, week and month for CityPlay. CityPlay is a bowling/minigolf business located in Madrid. Predictions will be based on 5 years of sales data plus the daily historical weather data for each day (more sales if it is raining). I will also be bringing in Holiday data for Madrid as it also has a big effect on sales.  Another metric I will be incorporating will be google trend data for keywords like "bowling", "minigolf", "arcade" ,"bolera", etc. specific to the Madrid region. Using an API I will serve the forecasts and visualizations using streamlit or flask.
